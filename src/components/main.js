                    Œûthtective is an alternative Ethereum explorer focused on
                    showing relationships and transactions between addresses.
                    Use it to sniff out the flow of Ether and Tokens. See how
                    scams are actually leading back to the same

                    (yeah it's a whale). Observe the historical activity of
                    famous addresses such as the Dao. Find the bastard that
                    hacked your wallet; and if he participated in an ICO with
                    KYC call law enforcement.
