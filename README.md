# Metadata Registry

Ethtective is an Ethereum transaction explorer that gives you better overview of blockchain activity than traditional blockchain explorers. This relies on adding visual cues based on data gathered from various APIs. Sadly, this means that this data remains locked up in silos and is not readily available on-chain to other contracts. 

https://cafe.ethtective.com is a proof of concept to illustrate the value of on-chain Metadata. More is forthcoming!
